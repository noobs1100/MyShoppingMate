I leave my charger at home. The battery lasts the whole day with a weight of just 1350g. Majja ni life.\nCons\n1. Gets hot while doing nothing. You can feel the heat on the keyboard.\n2.

I didn't check before purchasing, considering it as an obvious feature for the price.\n5. Lots of bloatware, i.e. Spotify and others\n6. Camera is said as 1080p. My USB 1080p external camera is way better than the inbuilt one. Don't know why so much difference. bad camera.\n7. Speeds up for the benchmark testing, starts heating and slows down (throttle) in less than 10 seconds. Cannot use i7 processor to its full potential because of throttling. Should have better cooling system.\n8. Keyboard, useless. As I gear up for touch typing screen starts shaking.\n9. Touchpad. Too big. Disturbs while typing.\n\nUpdate: Amazon and lg both denied providing 6 month subscription of the office 365.

First impression -> Good build quality - for the launch price of 51k after discounts for 16gb variant , no other laptop comes even close.\nNow coming to usability and practicality - lets start with cons\n\nCONS:\n\n1) H series CPU in laptop means heating - when using multi tasking or running benchmarks - Laptop becomes too hot neat left side keyboard and palm area. Only single FAN is not sufficient for h series laptops . Being metal laptop, heat is spread across laptop .  Multi core throttling happening when running benchmarks .If you are using for normal things like video  ,browsing etc. then fine.  Should have given 1240p instead as it would have bought IRIS graphics compared to current UHD . If you have to use it for performance or editing 4k etc. , skip this laptop. Ryzen 7 7730u is way less heat for good multi core performance and slight less single core\n\n2) 720P webcam is horrible - image is blurred .  In these days when most laptops come with good FHD cam , the camera is not usable for meetings . So its useless cam\n\n3) The full sized keyboard has serious issue - backspace, shifty and enter key are half of usual size.  Unnecessarily they have accommodated arrow keys as full keys and reduced size of right shift , enter and backspace keys . this causes so many issues while typing if you are used to standard keypads of laptops like dell , samsung , asus etc\n\n4) Trackpad is small for 16 inch laptop - samsung laptop and dell laptops offer way bigger trackpads. Touchpad is responsive though.\n\n5) Charger is brick charger, and when you insert in socket , its so wide that switch you cant access for on or off. Samsung also gives same charger but its well designed with groove for switches. Such an inconvenience.\n\n6) Only one usb c port - so either you charge your laptop or use as display to connect external. Both cant be done. There is HDMI but usb c is very convenient for docks\n\nPROS:\n\na) Best metal build around 50k\nb) Best Screen in 50k - period. 16:10 aspect ratio is so productive while using editing videos and coding etc. 100% SRGB is BOE company manufactured screen which is very good for price. MATTE screen so less glare\nc) Keyboard is good tactile (apart from con issue of size of keys which i mentioned earlier)\nd) Color is very good. Looks premium\ne) Performance is very good (apart from throttling in high intensive.)\nf) Disk read write is very good. High frequency RAM used.\ng) Speakers are best for 50k laptop price. Better than my  Samsung book 3 speakers costing 75k\n\nI also got free 1 year Microsoft office 365 personal (needed to add to card while ordering)\n\nOverall still best laptop at 50k with core i5 12th gen and full metal build. Period .\nService may be a concern but as of now cant comment of that.\n\nIf webcam is improved, and double fan was used to reduce heating and keyboard was not shortened, this would have been best laptop!", "summary": "The review is for the Honor MagicBook X14 laptop.

The M1 chip is a game-changer and offers unparalleled speed and efficiency, making it a joy to use. The 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visuals that are easy on the eyes. The laptop comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD Storage, which offers ample space to store files and run multiple applications without any lag. The Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video quality for virtual meetings.\n\nOne of the standout features of this laptop is the Touch ID feature. It is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwords. This feature, combined with the overall speed and efficiency of the M1 chip, makes for a smooth and seamless user experience. Additionally, the laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devices.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks to this laptop that led me to give it a 4-star rating. Firstly, the laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasks, such as video editing or running multiple applications simultaneously. This can be quite uncomfortable and sometimes even affect performance. Secondly, the battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usage. This is a bit of a letdown, as one of the key benefits of the M1 chip was supposed to be its efficiency and battery life.\n\nFinally, the lack of ports is a bit of a drawback. The laptop only comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means that users will need to purchase additional dongles or hubs to connect other devices. This can be inconvenient and adds to the overall cost of the laptop. Additionally, the absence of an SD card slot is a bit of a bummer, as it is a commonly used port by photographers and videographers.\n\nIn conclusion, the Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop with M1 chip is a great investment and offers a lot of features and benefits, but it does have some drawbacks. It is a powerful and efficient machine that is great for everyday use, but it may not be the best choice for professionals who require more intensive applications. Despite the drawbacks, I would still recommend it to anyone in the market for a high-performance laptop that offers speed, efficiency, and convenience.\n\nBullet points:\n\nThe M1 chip provides unparalleled speed and efficiency\nThe 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visuals\nThe Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video quality\nThe Touch ID feature is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwords\nThe laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devices\nThe laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasks\nThe battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usage\nThe lack of ports, particularly the absence of an SD card slot, is a bit of a drawback", "summary": "The Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop with M1 chip is a powerful and efficient machine that is great for everyday use, but it may not be the best choice for professionals who require more intensive applications.

RAM management: I run chrome with 8-10 tabs open, heavy programs running that takes 14GB / 16GB RAM in my Mi notebok pro, this one manages it with 7GB / 8GB RAM. That's all. I felt some lag opening photoshop, 2-3 seconds delay clicking open button and actually opening of photoshop application, but I don't mind it.

While it may not be the most powerful laptop out there, it is certainly a good choice for everyday use.\n\nThe laptop is equipped with an 11th Generation Intel i3 processor, which is fast enough for most tasks such as web browsing, word processing, and watching videos. The 15.6-inch Full HD display is bright and clear, and the colors are vibrant. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the touchpad is responsive and accurate.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate about this laptop is its design. It has a sleek and modern look with a slim profile, making it easy to carry around. The build quality is solid, and it feels sturdy in your hand. The laptop also has a good selection of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and a headphone jack, which makes it easy to connect to external devices.\n\nAnother aspect of this laptop that I like is its battery life. The laptop has a decent battery life, lasting around 7-8 hours on a single charge. This is good enough for a full day's work or study without having to worry about finding a power outlet.\n\nHowever, there are a few downsides to this.\n\nthe laptop's performance may be lacking if you plan to use it for more demanding tasks such as gaming or video editing.\n\nOverall, I would give the HP 15s 11th Generation Intel i3 laptop a four-star rating.

However, it may not be the best choice for users who need more storage or require high-performance computing.", "summary": "The HP 15s 11th Generation Intel i3 laptop is a good choice for everyday use.
